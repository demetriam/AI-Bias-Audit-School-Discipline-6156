Overview of My Experiment

Since working with real-world data can be challenging, the syn_data.py script generates synthetic school discipline data for model training. It creates a dataset representing 5,000 schools and simulates discipline incidents using a Poisson distribution. I wanted to also introduce random missing values to make the dataset more realistic. This synthetic dataset serves as the foundation for training the models in PBIS_model.py.
In the PBIS_model.pyI wrote a script to train machine learning models on synthetic school discipline data. I loaded a dataset, preprocesses the data using label encoding and standard scaling, and splits it into training and testing sets. The script trains both a Decision Tree Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier, 
evaluates their performance using classification reports and accuracy scores.
To assess model performance, I created the PBIS_visualizations.py script to visualizes accuracy scores of the trained models. It loads accuracy data from a JSON file and uses matplotlib and seaborn to generate a bar chart comparing different models. This helps in identifying the most effective model for predicting discipline outcomes.
The PBIS_recommendation.py script leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT model to generate personalized PBIS-based recommendations for student behavior interventions. It processes student behavior data, sends it as input to the AI model, and generates custom intervention strategies. I wanted to creates a PDF report containing these recommendations - here I was thinking it would be useful to have this printed in real world scenarios so teachers can easily refer to it. 
Together, these scripts form a structured pipeline for analyzing school discipline data, training AI models, visualizing their effectiveness, and generating AI-driven behavioral recommendations.
